ICFE                       only in decomp.f, looks broken anyway
ISTAR2                     machine supports 16-bit integers for pairlist

MPI                        parallel
MPI_BUFFER_SIZE
MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION
NCSU_ENABLE_BBMD           hope all these can go soon
NCSU_ENABLE_NODE_PRINT
NCSU_ENABLE_RMSD_CANNED
NCSU_NO_NETCDF
NCSU_REAL_IS_DOUBLE
NCSU_RMSD_CANNED
NDEBUG                     skip assert()'s if this is active
NMODE                      rarely used option for NMR relaxation matrix code
NO_RED_SCAT_INPLACE	       Do not do a mpi_reduce_scatter inplace - do it via 
                              a temporary array.
ORIGDERIV                  old way of doing NMR relaxation matrix analysis
PSANDER                    spatial decomposition parallel
PUPIL_SUPPORT              just for safety?
QMMM_OMP                   Protection for initial OpenMP threaded QMMM (experimental at present)
REM                        only in nmr.f, needed(?)

THIRDO                     old option for NMR relaxation matrix analysis
TRACE                      turn on code tracing, mostly to analyze MPI calls
TVDW                       use a truncated vdW interaction
USE_MPI_IN_PLACE	       This uses the more efficient in place methods of 
                           mpi v2 to do mpi operations rather than doing 
                           it with the less efficient temporary array method 
                           of mpi v1. This should be set if your MPI 
                           implementation supports it.
XLF90                      only for mexit.f
XREF                       safety(?) for x-ray refinement
